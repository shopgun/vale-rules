[Vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale) is an open source prose linter that can check the content of documents in several formats against style guide rules. The goal of a prose linter is automating style guide checks in docs-as-code environments, so that style issues are detected before deploy or while editing documentation in a code editor. 

This repo contains a set of linting rules for Vale based on the Elastic style guide and recommendations.

## Get started test

Run these commands to install the Elastic style guide locally:

**macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/vale-rules/main/install-macos.sh | bash
```

**Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/vale-rules/main/install-linux.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/vale-rules/main/install-windows.ps1 -OutFile install-windows.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install-windows.ps1
```

## Install the VS Code extension

Install the [Vale VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChrisChinchilla.vale-vscode) extension to view Vale checks when saving a document.

## Add the Vale action to your repo

Add the Elastic Vale linter to your repository's CI/CD pipeline using a two-workflow setup that supports fork PRs:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/vale-lint.yml
name: Vale Documentation Linting

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'docs/**/*.md'
      - 'docs/**/*.adoc'

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  vale:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Run Vale Linter
        uses: elastic/vale-rules/lint@main
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/vale-report.yml
name: Vale Report

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Vale Documentation Linting"]
    types:
      - completed

permissions:
  pull-requests: read

jobs:
  report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.workflow_run.event == 'pull_request'
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    
    steps:
      - name: Post Vale Results
        uses: elastic/vale-rules/report@main
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This two-workflow approach ensures fork PRs are linted safely while still posting results as PR comments.

## Folder structure

- `action.yml` - GitHub Action definition for using this as a reusable action
- `ACTION_USAGE.md` - Detailed documentation for using the GitHub Action
- `install-macos.sh` - Automated installation script for macOS
- `install-linux.sh` - Automated installation script for Linux
- `install-windows.ps1` - Automated installation script for Windows
- `styles/Elastic/` - Contains the Elastic linting rules for Vale. See [Styles](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/styles/)
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD workflows for testing and releases

The installation scripts create Vale configurations at platform-specific locations:

**macOS:**
- `~/Library/Application Support/vale/.vale.ini` - Vale configuration file
- `~/Library/Application Support/vale/styles/Elastic/` - Elastic style rules

**Linux:**
- `~/.config/vale/.vale.ini` - Vale configuration file
- `~/.local/share/vale/styles/Elastic/` - Elastic style rules

**Windows:**
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\vale\.vale.ini` - Vale configuration file
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\vale\styles\Elastic\` - Elastic style rules

## Updating

To update to the latest style guide rules, rerun the installation script.

## Testing locally

You can test Vale rules locally without creating a release. This is useful for developing and testing new rules or modifications to existing ones.

### Prerequisites

1. Install Vale on your system (use the installation scripts above, or install directly from [Vale's installation guide](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/)).
2. Clone this repository.

### Testing workflow

The repository includes a `.vale.ini` configuration file at the root that points to the local `styles/` directory:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd /path/to/elastic-style-guide

# Create a test Markdown file
echo "This uses eg, instead of for example." > test.md

# Run Vale using the local configuration
vale --config=.vale.ini test.md
```

Vale immediately uses the rules from the local `styles/Elastic/` directory. Any changes you make to rule files are reflected instantly without needing to create a release.

### Testing rule changes

1. Edit any rule file in `styles/Elastic/`:

```bash
# Example: modify the Latinisms rule
vim styles/Elastic/Latinisms.yml
```

2. Run Vale against a test file:

```bash
vale --config=.vale.ini your-test-file.md
```

3. Iterate on your changes until the rule works as expected.

The local `.vale.ini` configuration uses `StylesPath = styles`, which points directly to the local directory, so there's no need for releases or package syncing during development.

## Creating releases

To create a new release of the Vale package:

1. Update the version and make your changes.
2. Commit and push your changes to the main branch.
3. Create and push a version tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

The GitHub workflow automatically:

- Adds a VERSION file to the Elastic style directory.
- Packages the `.vale.ini` and `styles/` folder into `elastic-vale.zip` (a Vale complete package).
- Creates a new GitHub release with the version tag.
- Uploads the package as a release asset.

Users can then install or update to this version using the installation scripts or by running `vale sync`. The packaged `.vale.ini` ensures everyone gets the same configuration settings (SkippedScopes, IgnoredScopes, TokenIgnores, etc.).
